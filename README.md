# Mac Bootstrap

<!-- TODO continue to clean up -->

![mac-bootstrap screenshot][screenshot]

This script will provision a new machine running a fresh install of [macOS Big Sur (11.15)][bigsur]. It installs and configures software, dotfiles, and general preferences. The command line environment is based on [Zsh][zsh] running in [iTerm2][iterm2].

The [`bootstrap`][bootstrap] script is very specific to the Mac platform.

&#9657; **Looking for dotfiles only? Check out [My Dotfiles for macOS](https://github.com/JSaterdalen/dotfiles)**

## Prerequisites

1.  Make sure your software is up to date:

        sudo softwareupdate -i -a --restart

1.  Install Apple's command line tools:

        xcode-select --install

1.  Reboot, check for additional updates, then reinstall and reboot as needed.

## Installation

To install with a one-liner, run this:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSaterdalen/mac-bootstrap/master/bootstrap && sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/bootstrap.log
```

Want to read through the script first?

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JSaterdalen/mac-bootstrap/master/bootstrap
less bootstrap
sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/bootstrap.log
```

WARNING: This script will ask for your sudo password multiple times. You'll need to babysit it for a while. ðŸ˜‰

## What does it do?

When you invoke `bootstrap`, here's what it does:

- Step 1: Run an adaptation of thoughtbot's [Laptop script][laptop], tweaked from [joshukraine][joshukraine]. This is a provisioning script which installs lots of goodies like Homebrew, asdf, etc. My version is now stored locally in this repo under [`install/laptop`][my-laptop]. Step 1 also installs a variety of packages via [Homebrew Bundle][brew-bundle].
- Step 2: Install [Oh My Zsh][omz] if Zsh selected as default shell.
- Step 3: Set a variety of [macOS defaults][macos-defaults]. (adapted from [https://mths.be/macos][mths])
- Step 4: Clone [My Dotfiles for macOS][dotfiles] and symlink them to `$HOME` as needed.

## Post-install Tasks

After running `bootstrap` there are still a few things that need to be done.

- Restart your machine in order for some changes to take effect.
- Complete [post-install tasks][post-install-tasks] from dotfiles README.
- Set up desired macOS keyboard shortcuts (see list below)

## macOS Keyboard Shortcuts

These are my (current) primary macOS keyboard shortcuts:

- Alfred: &#8984;Space
- Clipboard (Alfred) &#8997;&#8984;C
- Spotlight search: &#8984;&#8679;Space
- Switch input source: &#8963;&#8679;Space
- Fantastical: &#8997;&#8984;Space
- iTerm2 hotkey window: &#8997;Space
- Remap Caps Lock to CTRL (anyone know a way to automate this?)

## How to personalize Mac Bootstrap for your own use.

No one else's development setup will ever be a perfect match for you. That said, if your needs are close enough to mine, you might benefit from using the same shell scripts and overall structure, and just swapping out the particulars with your own. Here's my recommended approach to doing that:

1. Fork this repo and clone your new fork to your local machine.

2. Review the `VARIABLE DECLARATIONS` section and customize as desired.

3. Review the 7 steps in [`bootstrap`][bootstrap] and make your own customizations. Here's an overview of what's going on:

- Step 1 (required): Take a look at [Laptop][laptop] and see what you might want to tweak. One of the biggest things to review is the `brew bundle` list of packages and casks that will be installed. Customize as needed. Laptop also sets up some basics that are required by the bootstrap script later on.
- Step 2 (recommended): Use Oh My Zsh?
- Step 3 (required): Review general macOS settings in `install/macos-defaults` and adjust as needed. This script also sets things like `HostName` which are needed later for the dotfiles installation.
- Step 4 (recommended): Install scripts to `~/bin`?
- Step 5 (recommended): Set up Tmuxinator profile?
- Step 6 (optional): Install Ukrainian language utilities? Maybe you're interested in some [other language extensions][lang-extensions]?
- Step 7 (required): The dotfiles. Update the `$DOTFILES_*` variables (see [`bootstrap`][bootstrap] under "VARIABLE DECLARATIONS") to reference your dotfiles. As a starting point, you can [fork mine][dotfiles] and then point to your fork.

4. Create `~/dotfiles/local/config.fish.local` or `~/.zshrc.local`, `~/.gitconfig.local`, and `~/.vimrc.local` and add in your personal information. These files are sourced in `~/.config/fish/config.fish` or `~/.zshrc`, `~/.gitconfig`, and `~/.vimrc` respectively.

5. Update the README with your own info, instructions/reminders so you don't forget what you did, and especially the correct install URL:

```sh
curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/mac-bootstrap/master/bootstrap && sh bootstrap 2>&1 | tee ~/boostrap.log
```

6. Run the script on your machine and wait for the first error. ðŸ˜‡ Then fix, commit, push, and repeat.
